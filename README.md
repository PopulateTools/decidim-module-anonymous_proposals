# Decidim::AnonymousProposals

Transform proposals component to allow not signed in users creation of
proposals. For this the proposals created anonymously will be linked with
a special anonymous users group. There is a task to create/update anonymous
groups in organizations explained in Installation section.

The creation of anonymous proposals can be disabled for each proposals
component individually. Once you have installed this module and added an
anonymous group, anonymous proposals will be enabled by default on all
proposal components.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

For Decidim 0.28:
```ruby
gem "decidim-anonymous_proposals", git: "https://github.com/PopulateTools/decidim-module-anonymous_proposals", branch: "release/0.28-stable"
```

For Decidim 0.27:
```ruby
gem "decidim-anonymous_proposals", git: "https://github.com/PopulateTools/decidim-module-anonymous_proposals", branch: "release/0.27-stable"
```

For Decidim 0.26:
```ruby
gem "decidim-anonymous_proposals", git: "https://github.com/PopulateTools/decidim-module-anonymous_proposals", branch: "release/0.26-stable"
```

For Decidim 0.25:
```ruby
gem "decidim-anonymous_proposals", git: "https://github.com/PopulateTools/decidim-module-anonymous_proposals", branch: "release/0.25-stable"

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

To have the functionality available there must be at least one anonymous user group.
An anonymous user group is a user group with `{ anonymous: true }` present in the
`extended_data` attribute. There is a task to create automatically or update the
first anonymous group of organizations (or a specific organization if its id is
provided).

The task accepts the following arguments:

1. Name of the group (default: "Anonymous")
2. Nickname of the group (default: "anonymous")
3. Email of the group (default: "anonymous@example.org")
4. organization_id. This argument is optional, if not provided a group is generated
   with the previous configurations for each organization

Example of use:

```bash
rake decidim_anonymous_proposals:generate_anonymous_group["Aportaciones an√≥nimas",anonima,anonymous@example.org]
```
